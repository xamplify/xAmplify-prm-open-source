# xAmplify PRM – Open Source Suite

Welcome to the **xAmplify Partner Relationship Management (PRM)** Open Source Ecosystem.

This repository serves as the **entry point** for the xAmplify PRM project — a modular, enterprise-ready platform for managing partner relationships effectively.

---

## 🚀 What's Included?

This suite consists of two open-source repositories:

| Project | Description | Repository |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Backend (Core)** | REST APIs, OAuth2 authentication, RBAC, and business logic built with Spring Boot | [xAmplify-prm-core](https://github.com/xamplify/xAmplify-prm-core) |
| **Frontend (UI)** | A user-friendly Angular UI powered by Angular Material | [xAmplify-PRM-UI](https://github.com/xamplify/xAmplify-PRM-UI) |

These two projects are designed to work together as a full-stack solution or independently as needed.
